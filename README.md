# Story2Personality #

The dataset is a new narrative understanding benchmark to predict personality according to the characterâ€™s narrative texts in the script. We release the dataset and the codes for our work accepted to NAACL Student Research Workshop 2022: *[Machine Narrative Comprehension in Fictional Characters Personality Prediction Task](https://arxiv.org/)* and EMNLP 2022 *[MBTI Personality Prediction for Fictional Characters Using Movie Scripts](https://arxiv.org/)*.


## Step 0: Env Setup ##
``` bash
conda env create -f person_environment.yml python=3.8 pandas=1.5.2
conda activate person
python -m spacy download en
```

## Step 1: Data Parsing ## 
Our data parser first reads the narrative books and movie scripts from HTML files, and then extracts utterances said by recognized characters. The whole process can take 3~5 hours to finish. If you are **only interested in the data**, you can download them via [this link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArPzysVAJSvtquRqYKCnbUlg-Vst5A?e=fIKIVO) and unzip to the root folder.
``` bash
# move the downloaded "dialog_scene_mention_dicts.zip" to the root folder
unzip dialog_scene_mention_dicts.zip
```

If you would like to know how the raw text data is processed, you will have to download the HTML files first from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArPzysVAJSvtquRp-2lEfVB3FatIiA?e=Hin01I). The contents are the union of [NarrativeQA dataset](https://github.com/deepmind/narrativeqa) and [Movie-Script-Database](https://github.com/Aveek-Saha/Movie-Script-Database). Please unzip the downloaded file to the root repo folder. 
``` bash
# move the downloaded "raw_texts.zip" to the root folder
unzip raw_texts.zip
```
We are also sharing some other preprocessed files in the **preprocessed/** folder which are also the dependencies of our parser. The following command would generate *dialog_dict.pickle*, *scene_dict.pickle*, and *mention_dict.pickle* from scratch. 
```
python parse.py
```

Hereto, you will get three `.pickle` files which contain dictionaries of "what people say" and "who are mentioned" in a dialogue or a scene.


## Step 2: Model Training and Inferencing ##
To use the data for modeling, please go to [dataset/](dataset/) and download one of the tokenized datasets. The format is more readily for training and testing than those `.pickle` files. More details will be provided in the future.
